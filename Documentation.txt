This file includes documentation of trigger.js

START BUILDING 

1) main driver is stored in "client" variable, we have switch/case for our driver to manage all four teamcity servers with one script.
in order to change server we should call getInstance(platform) function where we choose platform (Ios, Android, Mac, Windows)

2) so before executing build step we need to setParameters for build variables "CONDITION", "CONDITION_NAME", "TEST_TYPE",
this is happening inside startBuildConfig(buildNode) function. 

3) main function is startBuildConfig(buildNode) which triggers build with buildId. inside function we call
setParameters function and getResponseLastBuild(buildNodeMerged)

4) getResponseLastBuild(buildNodeMerged) gives respone of status and state until build running is finished. Also,
after finishinig it downloads build log;

5) getCondition() we pass TRUE if we want to get condition for VIDEO, we pass FALSE if we need condition for AUDIO



ANALYSING

Second part of trigger.js is analyising builded step.

1) function checkAnalysing(platform) is main function where we use FALSE for mobile test analysing and TRUE for all others

2) copyFromTerminal() we use this to check if analyising is finished, it needs ssh server address, path of analysing file,
final destination where it should be copied.(these addresses are given in checkAnalysing() function)

3) for analyising file paths we use file "file_path.txt" where all paths are written on single line

4) Time Limit and check time for analyising. we pass CHECK TIME in miliseconds and MAXIMUM TIME LIMIT in seconds
for example if we pass (3000,30) it will check for file every 3 seconds for 30 seconds
